#Count Maximum Consecutive Oneâ€™s in the array

#Problem Statement: Given an array that contains only 1 and 0 return the count of maximum consecutive ones in the array.

"""
Input: prices = {1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1}
Output: 3
Explanation: There are two consecutive 1s and three consecutive 1s in the array out of which maximum is 3.

Input: prices = {1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1} 
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two consecutive 1's in the array.

#Approaches:
"""
1.Optimal Approach:
    #Lets take 2 variables count,max and intiliaze it to 0
    #Iterate through the given list and find out if the element is equal to 1 then increase count by 1.
    #If the current number is not equal to 1 then update max with finding a max element between count and max.
    #Finally, after the completition of loop find out the maximum and print it.

# Search Element in a Rotated Sorted Array
# Problem Statement: Given an integer array arr of size N, sorted in ascending order (with distinct values) and a target value k. Now the array is rotated at some pivot point unknown to you. Find the index at which k is present and if k is not present return -1.

"""
Example 1:
Input Format: arr = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2,3], k = 0
Result: 4
Explanation: Here, the target is 0. We can see that 0 is present in the given rotated sorted array, nums. Thus, we get output as 4, which is the index at which 0 is present in the array.

Example 2:
Input Format: arr = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], k = 3
Result: -1
Explanation: Here, the target is 3. Since 3 is not present in the given rotated sorted array. Thus, we get the output as -1.
"""

#Approach:
"""
Identify the sorted half, check where the target is located, and then eliminate one half accordingly:
If arr[low] <= arr[mid]: This condition ensures that the left part is sorted.
If arr[low] <= target && target <= arr[mid]: It signifies that the target is in this sorted half. So, we will eliminate the right half (high = mid-1).
Otherwise, the target does not exist in the sorted half. So, we will eliminate this left half by doing low = mid+1.
Otherwise, if the right half is sorted:
If arr[mid] <= target && target <= arr[high]: It signifies that the target is in this sorted right half. So, we will eliminate the left half (low = mid+1).
Otherwise, the target does not exist in this sorted half. So, we will eliminate this right half by doing high = mid-1.

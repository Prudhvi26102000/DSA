Problem statement
You are given an array 'nums' of â€˜nâ€™ integers.
Return all subset sums of 'nums' in a non-decreasing order.

Note:
Here subset sum means sum of all elements of a subset of 'nums'. A subset of 'nums' is an array formed by removing some (possibly zero or all) elements of 'nums'.

For example
Input: 'nums' = [1,2]
Output: 0 1 2 3
Explanation:
Following are the subset sums:
0 (by considering empty subset)
1 
2
1+2 = 3
So, subset sum are [0,1,2,3].

Sample Input 1 :
3
1 2 3
Sample output 1 :
0 1 2 3 3 4 5 6
Explanation For Sample Output 1:
For the first test case,
Following are the subset sums:
0 (by considering empty subset)
1
2
1+2 = 3
3
1+3 = 4
2+3 = 5
1+2+3 = 6
So, subset-sums are [0,1,2,3,3,4,5,6]
